# Simple Weather App

A simple weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created during my free time as part of my personal portfolio. It allows users to check the current weather conditions by simply entering the name of a city. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- **Real-time weather data**: Displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition for any given city.
- **Search functionality**: Users can search for weather information by city name.
- **Responsive design**: The app is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **User-friendly interface**: Clean and simple UI to quickly show weather information.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To structure the app's layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the app to make it look clean and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: To handle dynamic content, interact with the weather API, and update the UI based on the fetched data.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions.
